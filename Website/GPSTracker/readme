Welcome to the django project folder!

I've created this so you know the purpose for each of the folders and files.

Folder Layout:
|-GPSTracker  <---The main configuration folder for the project
|   |-- settings.py <-- holds all of the settings for our project. If any other
|   |                    django packages are needed, they should be added to the
|   |                    Apps section. Everything should be good to go
|   |
|   |-- urls.py     <-- Defines all of the URLS and their specified views for 
|   |                     each page within our site. If we add a new page we will
|   |__                   need to define a new URL.
|
|-manage.py         <-- Runs various development features/options. Some are: 
|   |                          syncdb - syncs the associated db with the model
|   |                                    file from the tracker dir
|   |                       runserver - runs the development server. You should
|   |                                    do this to test your recently changed
|   |                                    python server code. 
|   |                                   - Any html/web code changes are 
|   |                                     automatic and there is no need to run 
|   |__                                   this.
|    
|-static      <-- Holds any static (image, css, etc) files used in the site 
|-templates   <-- Holds the html files for our website. 
|  |-- base.html   <-- the main template file that all other pages are built 
|  |                    from. For more info on the templating system, check out:
|  |                    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/
|  |-- index.html  <-- The entry point of our website. The map should go under
|  |                    the {% extends content %} tag.
|  |-- help.html   <-- Help page
|  |-- about.html  <-- About us page
|  |-- contact.html <-- Cotact us page
|  |__
|
|-tracker     <-- Holds our actual site's files.
|  |-- models.py   <-- Holds the python-representation for our database, used
|  |                    to dynamically generate the database with the syncdb 
|  |                    command in manage.py.
|  |
|  |-- views.py    <-- Defines the views for each page as it is loaded. This is
|  |                   where the bulk of our code will be placed.
