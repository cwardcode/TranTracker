This is the main working directory for our capstone project. 

This dir can be accessed by visiting: http://corp.cwardcode.com/capstone. I 
figure we could put anything extra related to the project here, if need be.

Even though this is the main directory for the site, it isn't served from here,
instead it's served from the GPSTracker subfolder as it's a Django project.
The actual capstone site can be accessed at: http://tracker.cwardcode.com


Folder Layout:
 --GPSTracker  <---Holds our django website - see its readme for more details
 --ChatService <---Holds the Chat service system for users to interact with each                   other
